            <div>
                During my life I didn`t have any experience which is related to programming or some other work with <ins>computers</ins> at all.<br />
                My first meeting with programming was at college during my studies. <br />
                In the other hand I just want to mention that I was working as a driver of people who are comming from Middle East.<br /> <dfn>
                    Middle East - the Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia, Turkey (both Asian and European), and Egypt (which is mostly in North Africa).
                    <br />Saudi Arabia is geographically the largest Middle Eastern nation while Bahrain is the smallest.
                </dfn> <br />
                I was in need of it because of earning money for my scholarship. It`s all about my 24 life work experience.

                I`m studing at <a href="http://www.ius.edu.ba"> International University of Sarajevo ( IUS ) </a> – Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences ( Computer Science and Engineering – CS ).<br />
                I`m not graduate this year, I hope next year I will graduate. <br />
                I have still one more year to go on.<br />
                I graduated from high school in 2014 in my hometown Travnik.<br />
                I graduated as a student of <a href="http://medresa.edu.ba/">Elči-Ibrahim pašina medresa.</a> It was a beautiful experience to be a part of that school.<br />
                Its not just educational school, its more about upbringing school.

                I wish always to work some real things about programming but my knowledge is not on that level.<br />
                I couldn`t make any project that is enough good ( don`t mean small or big ) to implement it on Github or some similar sites for sharing code.<br />
                Now on this Web Application Development course I will give my best to gain knowledge so that I have some serious projects to implement.

            <div>
                At college we were learning or studing programming languages like C, C++, Java, C# with ASP.NET framework using <acronym title="Model-View-Controller ">MVC</acronym> pattern. <br />
                To be honest I`m not expertise in any of these languages which I enlisted. <br />
                We just covered basic things about it.<br />
                I would like to work (learn how to work) as a developer. <br />
                I had that desire from before but I didn`t have a chance to start doing it. <br />
                I never did anything about development so I have to start doing it from scratch.<br />
                Now I have chance that I won`t miss during this semester to learn <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"> HTML </acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, JavaScript, so I will have good background to start working.<br />
                I hope with our <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Ali Abd Almisreb we will gain much more powerful knowledge then we used to get until now.
                We are using a book an <cite>HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites </cite> by Jon Duckett.
